# HorizonX-AIDA-Scorer

A machine learning app that scores emails based on the AIDA criteria to assess whether an email is of good quality to send out for marketing campaigns. Any score higher than a 25 is a good cold email. This model was trained on synthetic data so I am looking to find real world B2B cold email data sets. 

To use the program do python model/predict.py and enter the text of the email you wish to score.
