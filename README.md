"# HorizonX-AIDA-Scorer" 

A machine learning app that scores emails based on the AIDA criteria to assess whether an email is of good quality to send out for marketing campaigns. Any score higher than a 25 is a good cold email. This model was trained on synthetic data so I am looking to find real world B2B cold email data sets.
